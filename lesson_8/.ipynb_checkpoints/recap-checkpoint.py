1. Never use the print statement showing something in pandas
2. Share te file not the codes itself
3. The .plot() always displays the index

__________ SOLVING BUGS __________

4. Is it an error or unintended behavior?
5. Stacktraces -> look at the bottom of the error, you can see there what kind of error it is
	- In all these places something went wrong

6. The print statement gives the first characters of every string in a list:

friends = ["Tinus", "Barrie", "Hans"]
for name in friends:
	print(name[0])

print shows: T B H.

Solution: Use print(name) to debug this 'error'.
